# Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of this app, Iâ€™ve gained some valuable insights into managing states (useState and useEffect) and using LocalStorage to enhance user experience also I've finally understand the use of context API that let's me avoid prop drilling when the state becomes 3 or more levels deep.

# The Challenges

One of the key challenges I encountered while implementing the Context API was organizing and managing the context hierarchy and structure within my project. As the application grew, maintaining a clear and logical structure for my contexts became increasingly complex. It was sometimes tricky to determine the best way to structure providers and consumers to ensure that data flowed seamlessly without causing confusion.

**Form Validation** this is one of the most difficult task that I've encountered and I look forward in improving as I make more JS projects using different forms

# Keys for Improvement

For the Form validation:

**Making it More Clear and Planning Ahead** For me the reason on why i struggle on this part because I''ve never planned the data structure for the app and also I didn't created pseudocodes which was my crucial mistake since as I think of a feature it became difficult for me to manage. So next time I create another app, I will plan ahead this time.
